# SNB — front-end performance (SSSMP1VUIO-3176)

Project branch `project/snb`. Plan: [`specs/perf-front-end.md`](../../specs/perf-front-end.md).

## Setup

```powershell
npm ci; npx playwright install chromium
Copy-Item config\projects\snb.example.properties config\local.properties   # perf.* tuning only
```

Environments are aliases: `config/environments/<alias>.env` (gitignored; template `example.env`).
Each holds the UI URL, batch host, DB connection and passwords of one environment
(source: Confluence "Environments Details V9"). Pick one per command:

```powershell
npm run nr -- qa1                        # print resolved config for qa1
npm run nr -- perf test:perf:screens     # run an npm script against perf
$env:NR_ENV = "dev1"; npm run test:perf  # or set it for the whole PowerShell session
```

Aliases: dev1, dev2, qa1, qa2, qa4, inst1, proddev, prodqa, perf, perf2. `NR_ENV` wins over `ENV_FILE`
and the root `.env`. For DB tests, set `DB_PASSWORD` in the alias file.

## Runs

| What | Command | Ticket scope |
|---|---|---|
| Screen baseline, 1 user | `npm run nr -- perf test:perf:screens` | Screen timing (future iteration) |
| Concurrent workload + top SQL | `npm run nr -- perf test:perf:load` | First pass DoD |
| All Alerts SQL (2969) | `npm run nr -- perf test:perf:db` | First pass DoD (note) |
| Everything | `npm run nr -- perf test:perf` | |
| Compare releases | `npm run perf:compare -- <old>/summary.json <new>/summary.json` | Comparison between releases |

### Every screen of every user

`perf.screens=auto` (in `config/local.properties`): after login each user reads its own menu and opens every
screen in it. The console lists what each user will open and what is left out:

```
[VU 1 admin] And I read the main menu available to "admin"  →  N screens to open, M left out
[VU 1 admin]     left out: "Services Manager->Reload Configuration" (global action — never opened)
```

`reports/perf/<runId>/menus.json` has the same per login. Reload…/ReCalculate…/Get Next… are never opened.

### 100 concurrent users

`config/local.properties` holds the SNB load profile: all 26 role logins, `perf.virtualUsers=100`.
Loads above 5 users run only on `perf` / `perf2`; on qa/dev aliases the load test is skipped.
One machine needs roughly 150 MB free RAM per user. Where that is not available, start the
same load run on several machines with a smaller `perf.virtualUsers` each (e.g. 4 × 25), then:

```powershell
npm run perf:merge -- reports/perf/<runA> reports/perf/<runB> reports/perf/<runC> reports/perf/<runD> --out=reports/perf/R2.06.1_load_100vu
```

Each run prints one Gherkin line per step and virtual user (`perf.printSteps=false` silences it);
the HTML report (`npx playwright show-report`) has the same steps as a tree.

Results: `reports/perf/<runId>/` — `measurements.csv`, `summary.json`, `summary.md`,
`top-sql.csv` (v$sql delta of the run), `window.json` (exact run window for the custom DB report).
Set `PERF_RUN_ID` to name the folder. Do not pass `--reporter` on the command line: that replaces
the configured perf reporter.

Keep an agreed baseline as `perf/baselines/<release>/summary.json` and point `perf.baselineFile` at it.

## Before running on PERF

- PERF is switched off to save costs — agree the slot with Yaro first.
- Concurrency = browser contexts in one Chromium (`perf.virtualUsers`), **not** Selenium Grid
  sessions, so the 4-session Grid limit does not apply. Size the agent for ~150–300 MB RAM per user.
- Use one distinct login per virtual user (`perf.users`); NR may end an earlier session of the same user.
- The journey is read-only except for the alert lock taken by opening an alert (released by Back).
  Virtual users open different rows to avoid contending for one lock.
- `perf.db.captureTopSql` needs SELECT on `V_$SQL` for `DbUsername`. `top-sql.csv` holds SQL text
  that may contain literal customer values — keep it inside the project and attach it only to internal tickets.
- `db-query-timings` is expected to **fail** until SSSMP1VUIO-2969 is fixed (target < 1 s).

## First run on PERF — verify

The page objects were migrated from NAT selectors and checked only against a local mock of the
NR markup. On the first real run, confirm:

1. Menu screens replace the document and show an `h1` title (the ready check for `MENU …`).
2. All Alerts Search redraws `table[id*="interactiveListTable"]` (the ready check for `ALL_ALERTS_SEARCH`).
3. An alert opens in the same tab and shows `a[id*="KeyAction"]`.

If a check does not hold, fix the page object (`src/ui/pages/*`) and leave the assertions unchanged.
